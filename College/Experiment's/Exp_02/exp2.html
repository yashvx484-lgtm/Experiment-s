                        the White House to discuss bilateral ties.Mr. Trump said
                        a “great leader” was coming while talking to reporters
                        at the White House after signing several executive
                        orders on Thursday (September 25, 2025) “In fact, we
                        have a great leader coming, the Prime Minister of
                        Pakistan coming, and the field marshal [of] Pakistan.
                        Field marshal is a very great guy and so is the Prime
                        Minister, both. And they’re coming,” Mr. Trump said.This
                        was the first formal bilateral interaction between Mr.
                        Trump and Mr. Sharif, coming six years after former
                        premier Imran Khan met Mr. Trump during the latter’s
                        first term in July 2019. Mr. Sharif is in the U.S. for
                        the 80th session of the United Nations General Assembly
                        and will address the General Debate from the UNGA podium

                        start at 4:30 p.m. (local time) but was delayed by about
                        30 minutes due to President Trump’s engagements. It
                        continued for approximately one hour and 20 minutes.

            Oracle Chairman and CTO Larry Ellison has said that artificial
            intelligence (AI) would fundamentally reshape how humanity solves
            complex problems—from healthcare and infrastructure to agriculture
            and climate. Delivering the keynote at the Oracle AI World 2025 in
            Las Vegas, he described AI as a network of “electronic brains” that
            augment people rather than replace them. He called it a force “more
            powerful than the Industrial Revolution.” “The real opportunity is
            not just building these extraordinary electronic brains, but using
            them to solve humanity’s most difficult problems,” Ellison said,
            outlining how Oracle is positioning its cloud and enterprise
            software stack to enable AI reasoning securely on both public and
            private data.
          </p>

          <p style="text-align: justify">
            Ellison cited healthcare as one of the most promising testbeds for
            AI ecosystems. Beyond modernising Cerner’s electronic health record
            (EHR) software, he envisioned interconnected AI agents that automate
            the entire healthcare value chain—from patients and providers to
            insurers, regulators, and financial institutions. He illustrated how
            one agent could synthesise medical records, clinical research, and
            reimbursement policies to recommend optimal treatments that are both
            effective and covered under prevailing insurance rules. Another
            could assess verified receivables to help hospitals raise short-term
            interconnected AI agents that automate the entire healthcare value

            Ellison compared the human brain’s 20-watt power consumption with
            the <a style="color: red">1.2-billion-watt energy</a> demand of
            modern AI clusters to underline a simple truth: creating electronic
            brains requires industrial-scale digital infrastructure. The shift
            from neurons to GPUs, he said, has transformed computing into an
            engineering challenge that spans energy, cooling, and networking. To
            meet this demand, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) is being
            expanded into one of the world’s largest AI computing networks —
            including a new cluster in Abilene, Texas, that will eventually host
            more than <a style="color: blueviolet">450,000 NVIDIA GPUs</a>. The
            buildout integrates power generation, liquid cooling, and high-speed
            data links at a scale Ellison likened to “national infrastructure
            projects.” “We are building billion-watt power plants and connecting
            them directly to our data centres,” Ellison said. He added that true
            AI capability requires more than GPUs—it depends on the reliability
            of the surrounding digital infrastructure. “If you do not have the
            data pipelines, execution environments, and low-latency systems
            ready, it is like buying an F1 car and parking it on a dirt road.”
            Ellison said Oracle’s approach is distinct from other hyperscalers
            by combining massive AI infrastructure with vertical applications
            for industries such as healthcare, finance, and utilities. The
            company, he noted, is training and hosting multiple multimodal
            models, including those from
            <a href="https://openai.com/">OpenAI</a> and xAI, while also
            providing customers with access to models such as
            <a href="https://grok.com/">Grok</a>,
            <a href="https://chatgpt.com/">ChatGPT</a>,<a
              href="https://www.llama.com/"
              >Llama</a
            >
            , and <a href="https://gemini.google.com/">Gemini</a> in its cloud.
            From public data to private reasoning Ellison highlighted a
            fundamental limitation of today’s general-purpose models: they are
            trained almost entirely on public internet data. “ChatGPT does not
            know your accounts, your customer orders, or your supplier
            contracts,” he said. The next breakthrough, he argued, will come
            from enabling AI to reason over private, enterprise-owned data
            without compromising security. Oracle’s new AI Database and AI Data
            Platform, he explained, “vectorise” data stored in Oracle and
            third-party clouds so that AI models can access and reason on it
            through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). This
            privacy-preserving approach allows customers to combine public and
            proprietary data while maintaining full ownership and control. The
            goal, Ellison said, is to move from passive information retrieval to
            active reasoning. “Inference is no longer about finding the right
            answer—it is about deciding what to do under complex conditions,” he
            said, emphasising that such reasoning engines could transform entire
            sectors.

            worldwide), and also a strong emphasis on engineering, product-depth
            and staying independent of the large cloud infrastructure providers
            in some cases. The Economic Times +1 Because of its roots in
            enterprise SaaS, Zoho has traditionally been known for targeting
            SMEs (small and mid-sized enterprises), offering broad integrated
            tool-sets (for example Zoho One) and making inroads internationally.
            But relatively less so, until now, in the mass-consumer messaging
            space or as a direct challenger to the biggest productivity suites
            (such as Google Workspace or Microsoft 365). What makes the current
            phase interesting is that Zoho is making two bold moves: into
            consumer (or semi-consumer) messaging with Arattai; and into
            workplace collaboration with Vani, directly targeting the
            productivity/collaboration incumbents. These moves suggest Zoho sees
            an opportunity to expand its footprint significantly — not just in
            adjacent niches, but in big battles.

            Adoption and momentum According to multiple sources, Arattai has
            crossed 7.5 million overall downloads as of October 3, 2025 (across
            Google Play and Apple App Store). The Economic Times One article
            puts it that it has become one of the fastest adoption feats for 
            local (“Made in India”) messaging app. Rediff +1 The surge appears
            to be driven by a confluence of factors: rising interest in domestic
            alternatives to global tech apps, strong word-of-mouth and
            social-sharing plus endorsements or encouragement for home-grown
            apps in India. The Economic Times +1 In an X post (Twitter) founder
            Sridhar Vembu wrote about how the team had worked for years without
            expecting this kind of “take-off” and emphasised “stay the course,
            allow neither praise nor criticism nor fame to distract you” in
            reference to the Arattai team. The Economic Times +1 So far, the
            download momentum is impressive and noteworthy for a challenger app.
            It is signalling traction and strong interest. Key features &
            positioning According to reporting, Arattai offers core messaging
            functionality: text, voice messages, voice & video calls, sharing of
            photos/videos/documents, group chats/channels. In fact in one
            article the app is described as “simple on the surface, but with a
            lot of depth inside” due to the in-house real-time messaging/AV
            framework that Zoho says it has been perfecting for 15 years. The
